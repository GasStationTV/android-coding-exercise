#TODO: Create a Flickr app api key for use in your app: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/
#TODO: Using Android Studio, implement app functionality

A basic app skeleton has been provided that needs completion. 

Class PictureGridFragment should interface with the ActionBar SearchBar component to search the Flickr Photo' API,
then upon returning a list of photos, populate thumbnails of the photos into the gridView container.

Clicking on a photo thumbnail should show the LargePictureFragment, where a larger version of the Flickr Photo should be shown.

DiskLruMediaCache class should be used to cache Flickr Photos on disk for fast re-access times.

A sample LoginActivity class has been provided as an extra challenge to demonstrate user login and authentication.
